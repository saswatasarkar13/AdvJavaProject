                Our responsibilities
                We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your donor record. We actively
                implement security measures to ensure your information is safe, and audit these regularly. All our staff and
                anyone who  receives information from us have a legal duty to keep information about you confidential.
                <br><br>
                We will not release your personal details to any third party without first seeking your consent, unless
                this  is  allowed for or required by law.
                <br><br>
                We are constantly working to ensure compliance with current data protection legislation.

                Your rights Data protection legislation gives you, the donor, various rights. The most important of these are as
                follows:
                <br><br>
                You have the right to a copy of information we hold about you.
                You have the right to ask for your record to be amended if you believe that it is wrong.
                You have the right to be forgotten. You can request to be removed from the Service if you have yet to
                make a donation or provided any medical information.
                If you have any further questions about how we use your information, please contact our helpline 0300
                123 23 23, or by completing our contact us form
                <br><br>
                How to access your records
                You can access the information we hold about you by writing to the Customer Services Team at the address
                given below. Please include as much information as possible to help us locate your records, including
                your full name, date of birth, email address and postal address, plus your Donor ID if you have it. It will also
                help us know if we are to look for recent records, or from how long ago. Please apply in writing rather than by
                email, so that we receive an original signature to compare against the records we hold.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes, we may have to ask for more details in order to identify you correctly and locate the
                information you are interested in. If you only want some of your record, rather than everything, then please tell us
                when you apply. Subject access is provided free of charge. You may choose whether to visit your nearest NHS Blood
                and Transplant centre to collect your records, or to have Royal Mail Special Delivery to your home address.
